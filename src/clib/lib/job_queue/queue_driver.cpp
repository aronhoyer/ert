/*
   This file implements the datatype queue_driver_type which is an
   abstract datatype for communicating with a subsystem for
   communcating with other low-level systems for running external
   jobs. The job_queue instance, which will handle a queue of jobs,
   interacts with the jobs through a queue_driver instance.

   The queue_driver type is a quite small datastructure which "wraps"
   and underlying specific driver instance; examples of specific
   driver instances are the lsf_driver which communicates with the LSF
   system and the local_driver which runs jobs directly on the current
   workstation. The queue_driver type contains essentially three
   different types of fields:

    1. Functions pointers for manipulating the jobs, and the state of
       the low-level driver.

    2. An opaque (i.e. void *) pointer to the state of the low level
       driver. This will be passed as first argument to all the
       function pointers, e.g. like the "self" in Python methods.

    3. Some data fields which are common to all driver types.
